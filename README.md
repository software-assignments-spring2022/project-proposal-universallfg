# Universal LFG
Today's most popular video games are those that feature highly competitive multiplayer game modes. Whether it be Call of Duty, Apex Legends, Destiny, Valorant — or any other game — having a team you can communicate with can mean the difference between winning annd losing. 
Universal LFG (Looking for Group) would be a platform that can connect players in need of a group to each other. 

### Who is Universal LFG For?
The end users of Universal LFG would be gamers who don't have access to a group to play their favorite games with. 

### Universal LFG - Breakdown
Typical user experience will be as follows:
* Registration/Login
    * Registration: User creates and populates their profile (username, age, etc.). User can indicate what platforms they are active on, as well as their usernames for those platforms.  
    * Login: If user has an active account, they can log in. Logged in users are redirected to the **homepage**
* Homepage 
    * Users can add games to their homepage. When this is done, clickable icons for each games are rendered on the page, giving users access to the **LFG boards/forum** for those games. 
* Create and browse LFG posts
    * Create Post:  User specifies the activity they would like to play (example: ranked or public matches) as well as other join criteria they may have (level, rank, etc.). User also specifies how many people they need for that activity. That post is then published to the public board. It would be cool to see a real-time visualization of empty player slots being filled. Once all slots are filled, the post is locked. 
    * Browse: User can browse through posts. If they see there is a group that planning on doing an activity that interests them, they can select that post and click on an empty slot to join.
  
### Scope
At its core, Universal LFG would be a collection of forum-type pages. Ideally, "Universal" would imply the ability to access LFG boards for all relevant games, but for the sake of being able to finish the project in a semester, the group should decide on a limited number of games to set up boards for. Additionally, the boards should be of high quality, with selection options specific to each game. Although it is challenging to determine the difficulty of the project, I believe it should be engaging enough for a group of 4-6.
